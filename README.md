# iShouvik WP - Bootstrap Theme for WordPress

This is a blank Wordpress Theme Skeleton using Twitter Bootstrap 3 and Fontawesome. Please, feel free to use this theme in any way you want.

Uses Twitter Bootstrap and FontAwesome CDNs for better performance.

I would personally recommend you to create your own Child themes to give your wordpress site a customised look.
